# What I Find Interesting

The article focuses on how remote work is shaping how the software industry operates and its impact on what it means to be a developer. Since the pandemic, many tech companies have embraced remote work, including hybrid and remote working models, allowing companies to recruit exceptional talent globally. This shift expands opportunities for companies to increase their chances of finding the best fit for their teams while giving developers greater flexibility to choose where they want to work.

I agree with the authorâ€™s perspective that remote work provides more opportunities to work with colleagues from different countries and cultures. Exposure to diverse perspectives helps developers approach problems more creatively and produce more innovative solutions. However, the article also highlights the challenges of remote work, such as the difficulty of maintaining effective collaboration. This encourages remote teams to adopt better communication and self-management habits to minimize miscommunication and meet project deadlines. Remote work is reshaping the software industry, not only providing developers with location flexibility but also redefining what makes a great developer. In addition to technical expertise, strong soft skills like communication and self-management are now more essential than ever.

I also agree with the author's perspective and loved Jessica's summary. I was also interested in the authors focus on work-life balance as I can definitely see companies using remote work as a means for work to consume your home life as well. The benefits of remote work however, like more global hiring opportunities, exposure to diverse perspectives, etc..., far outweigh the negatives, but still can understand why companies, and even some employees, are still hesitant to try it out.
